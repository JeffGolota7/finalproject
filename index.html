        <p>I really like music, more specifically Hip-Hip music so I was thinking I could make a website that would track new releases from artists and if you didn't know about an artist you could click on them and it would give a biography of who they are and list their top songs and u can play them (this can actually be done through spotify by copying the code). There can be a home page that would briefly list upcoming releases and then another tab that would have a detailed list of what's coming out and when. Then there could be an about page for the website. The site could also expand to other genres.</p>
